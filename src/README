Patches and bug reports can be sent to the linux-media@vger.kernel.org
mailinglist (see https://www.linuxtv.org/lists.php). Please make sure
that 'edid-decode' appears in the subject line and don't forget to
add a 'Signed-off-by' line when submitting patches!

If you don't know what that is, then see:
https://elinux.org/Developer_Certificate_Of_Origin

New sample EDIDs are welcome. Please note that these must be real
EDIDs read from real hardware, so no artificially constructed EDIDs.

The naming of EDIDs in the data directory is:

<vendor>-<model>-<port>[-tileX]

<port> is one of dp, hdmi, vga, dvi
When a tile is also specified, then dp should include the DP connector
number, e.g. dp1-tile0, dp2-tile1.

All lower case.

If the EDID was modified by other devices in the chain (e.g. AV Receivers),
then name the EDID as:

<TV vendor>-<TV model>-<TV port>-<AV vendor>-<AV model>-<AV port>

The test directory contains some special input files to verify the
edid-decode parser and hand-crafted EDIDs to test rarely seen
EDID features.

I host a simple website where you can paste an EDID and get the full
edid-decode output here:

https://hverkuil.home.xs4all.nl/edid-decode/edid-decode.html

This is updated regularly with the latest edid-decode. It uses emscripten
and the html file is maintained in the emscripten directory of edid-decode.
To build it, set the project up using the provided crossfile:

	cd utils/edid-decode/emscripten
	meson setup build --cross-file ./wasm-crossfile.txt --prefix=`pwd`/build/install
	meson install -C build
	# serve the files using a local webserver
	cd build/install/bin
	python3 -m http.server

This assumes that emscripten is installed, of course. The location of the
toolchain can be adjusted in emscripten/wasm-crossfile.txt. Currently
it assumes that the emscripten tools are in your $PATH.
See also https://emscripten.org/docs/getting_started/Tutorial.html and
https://mesonbuild.com/Cross-compilation.html.

You can find a very large collection of EDIDs here:
https://github.com/linuxhw/EDID

This collection has been used to test edid-decode.
